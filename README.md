# Alien Night | A Dark Theme for Discourse 2.0

> After 2 years (scary), I finally got time to update this theme!
Over the time I developed a new theme based on that, which I migrated now to Alien Night. 
I hope you like it!

I wanna share a dark discourse theme I created for my [HWS server empyrion forum](https://forum.empyrion-homeworld.net).
It should be a combination of a dark space with the main color teal, secondary color orange and tertiary color green.

## Additional feature: Theme Switcher
Included is a theme switcher at the top Discourse Header where people can choose between a Light (default) Theme and this Dark theme.
I set a global modifier class in the html and store it in the local Storage. 
This way it is permanent and can react properly.

## Work in Progress

Since Discourse has dynamic and a lot of classes there might be still some contrast issues here and there.
Please create an Issue for that or write in the Forum topic about it and I'll try to fix it as soon as possible! :)
